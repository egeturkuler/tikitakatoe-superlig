# tikitakatoe-superlig

Footy-Tic-Tac-Toe game, based on https://playfootball.games/footy-tic-tac-toe/same-screen but with Turkish Super League players. The grid has teams on sides that and you have to know the players who played in both of those teams.You choose a box on the grid that you want to place your "X" (or "O" depending on your turn), then you have to find the player that is acceptable for that position on the grid.

Tic-tac-toe template is taken from https://github.com/javascriptacademy-stash/tic-tac-toe
